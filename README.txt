Facebook's Ad Archive is a searchable database. It includes ads related to politics and issues of national importance that have run on Facebook or Instagram. This report is a weekly summary of the archive and includes data for ads that have been viewed by people in the US for the time period selected above. Making this report available to the public is part of Facebook's efforts to increase transparency in advertising.
This file contains the following fields:

Amount Spent
This metric counts the amount spent by advertisers on ads in the archive either from the ad creation date or the start of the Ad Archive on May 7, 2018, (whichever came later) until the end of the selected week. This metric may include amounts already invoiced as well as billable amounts that haven't been invoiced yet. For ads that are currently running, these numbers may be an estimate, since it can take up to 48 hours for ad results to be processed.

The amount shown for the US report is equal to the amount spent on impressions for ads in the archive that reached people on Facebook and Instagram in the US from ad accounts which had USD set as the ad account currency. For full transparency we report all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Number of Ads in Archive
The total number of ads in the archive that were delivered on Facebook and Instagram from the start of the Ad Archive on May 7, 2018 to the end of the week selected. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Note: This report shows the number of ads related to politics and issues of national importance, and the total amount spent for those ads, reaching people in the US for the selected 7-day period. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in the Facebook's systems, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager tool.
